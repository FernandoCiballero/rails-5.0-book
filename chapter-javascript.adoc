[[javascript]]
= JavaScript

The focus of this chapter is not on explaining JavaScript. The aim is to
show you as a Rails programmer how you can integrate JavaScript in a
Rails application. Correspondingly, the chapters do not explain
JavaScript in detail. I am assuming that you can read and understand
JavaScript. If not, it may be better to skip this chapter. You can
happily get by without JavaScript.

[[jquery]]
== jQuery

By default, Rails 5 uses the jQuery Javascript library
(http://jquery.com/). If you do not require this library, you should
delete the following lines from the file
`app/assets/javascripts/application.js` within the asset pipeline
(see the section xref:asset-pipeline["Asset Pipeline"]):

[source,javascript]
----
//= require jquery
//= require jquery_ujs
----

With jQuery, you can implement animations and Ajax interactions on your
web page relatively easily.

You will find a good introduction to this topic in the jQuery
documentation at http://learn.jquery.com/

[[coffeescript]]
== CoffeeScript

For many Rails developers, CoffeeScript is the best thing invented since
the introduction of sliced bread. CoffeeScript is a simple programming
language that is converted to JavaScript via the asset pipeline. I am
going to use JavaScript and CoffeeScript in this chapter. If you would
like to know more about CoffeeScript, please look at the CoffeeScript
documentation at http://coffeescript.org/ and as so often there is also
an excellent Railscast on CoffeeScript available at
http://railscasts.com/episodes/267-coffeescript-basics.

[[javascript-helpers]]
== JavaScript Helpers

For using JavaScript in the view, there are some useful helpers
available.

[[javascript_tag]]
=== javascript_tag

The easiest way of using JavaScript one-liners in a view is via
`javascript_tag`.

With the following line in the view, you can execute an alert when the
page is accessed:

[source,erb]
----
<%= javascript_tag "alert('Just an example.')" %>
----

The HTML code generated is this:

[source,html]
----
<script type="text/javascript">
//<![CDATA[
alert('Just an example.')
//]]>
</script>
----

[[link_to_function]]
=== link_to_function

The helper `link_to_function` creates a link whose `onclick` handler
executes a JavaScript.

Again, here is a example for an alert. The ERB code in the view looks
like this:

[source,erb]
----
<%= link_to_function "trigger alert", "alert('Just an example.')" %>
----

The generated HTML code:

[source,html]
----
<a href="#" onclick="alert('Just an example.'); return false;">trigger
alert</a>
----

[[button_to_function]]
=== button_to_function

The helper `button_to_function` creates a button whose `onclick` handler
executes a JavaScript.

Once more the example with the alert. The ERB code in the view looks
like this:

[source,erb]
----
<%= button_to_function "trigger alert", "alert('Just an example.')" %>
----

The generated HTML code:

[source,html]
----
<input onclick="alert('Just an example.');" type="button" value="trigger
alert" />
----

[[example]]
== Example

The easiest way of explaining how you go about programming with
JavaScript and the asset pipeline in a Rails project is by using a
little example. As always, the main focus is not on creating an
amazingly meaningful application. ;-)

[[changing-form-depending-on-input]]
=== Changing Form Depending on Input

Letâ€™s build a room reservation system where you can book a single
or double room and then have to enter either one or two guest
names in the same form. The basic structure:

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ **rails new hotel**
  [...]
$ **cd hotel**
$ **rails generate scaffold reservation start:date end:date
  room_type:string guest_name1 guest_name2**
  [...]
$ **rails db:migrate**
  [...]
$ **rails server**
  [...]
----

With this setup we get a very spartanic and totally unnormalized
http://localhost:3000/reservations/new

image::screenshots/chapter13/hotel_zimmer_basic_form.png[Hotel basic form,title="Hotel basic form"]

That is not userfriendly. The aim is to display the following page when
you go to http://localhost:3000/reservations/new:

image::screenshots/chapter13/hotel_einzelzimmer_form.png[Hotel single room form,title="Hotel single room form"]

As soon as the user selects a double room instead of a single, we want a
second name field to appear:

image::screenshots/chapter13/hotel_doppelzimmer_form.png[Hotel double room form,title="Hotel double room form"]

So I am changing two things in the
`app/views/reservations/_form.html.erb`:

* Set the `room_type` via a dropdown box.

[source,erb]
.app/views/reservations/_form.html.erb
----
[...]
<div class="field">
  <%= f.select :room_type, options_for_select(['single room', 'double room']) %>
</div>
[...]
----

* In the div element around the second name, I set an ID `second_name'.

[source,erb]
.app/views/reservations/_form.html.erb
----
[...]
<div class="field" id='second_name'>
  <%= f.label :guest_name2 %>
  <%= f.text_field :guest_name2 %>
</div>
[...]
----

In the file `app/assets/javascripts/reservations.js.coffee` I define the
CoffeeScript code that toggles the element with the ID `second_name`
between visible (`show`) or invisible (`hide`) depending on the content
of `reservation_room_type`:

[source,coffeescript]
.app/assets/javascripts/reservations.js.coffee
----
ready = ->
  $('#second_name').hide()
  $('#reservation_room_type').change ->
    room_type = $('#reservation_room_type :selected').text()
    if room_type == 'single room'
      $('#second_name').hide()
    else
      $('#second_name').show()

$(document).ready(ready)
$(document).on('page:load', ready)
----

NOTE: In the real world, you would surely integrate the guest names
      in a 1:n `has_many` association, but in this example we just
      want to demonstrate how you can change the content of a form
      via JavaScript.
