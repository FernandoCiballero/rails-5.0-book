== The Data-Input Workflow

To understand forms we take a look at the data workflow. Understanding
it better will help to understand the work of forms.

Example application:

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ **rails new testapp**
[...]
$ **cd testapp**
$ **rails generate scaffold Person first_name last_name**
[...]
$ **rails db:migrate**
[...]
$ **rails server**
=> Booting Puma
=> Rails 5.0.0.1 application starting in development on http://localhost:3000
[...]
----

Most times we create forms by using the Scaffold. Let’s go through the
flow the data

[[request-the-peoplenew-form]]
=== Request the people#new form

When we request the http://localhost:3000/people/new URL the router
answers the following route:

[subs=+quotes]
----
new_person GET    /people/new(.:format)      people#new
----

The controller `app/controllers/people_controller.rb` runs this code:

[source,ruby]
.app/controllers/people_controller.rb
----
# GET /people/new
def new
  @person = Person.new
end
----

So a new Instance of `Person` is created and stored in the instance
variable `@person`.

Rails takes `@person` and starts processing the view file
`app/views/people/new.html.erb`

[source,erb]
.app/views/people/new.html.erb
----
<h1>New Person</h1>

<%= render 'form', person: @person %>

<%= link_to 'Back', people_path %>
----

`render 'form'` renders the file `app/views/people/_form.html.erb`
and sets the local variable `person` with the content of `@person`.

[source,erb]
.app/views/people/_form.html.erb
----
<%= form_for(person) do |f| %>
  <% if person.errors.any? %>
    <div id="error_explanation">
      <h2><%= pluralize(person.errors.count, "error") %> prohibited this person from being saved:</h2>

      <ul>
      <% person.errors.full_messages.each do |message| %>
        <li><%= message %></li>
      <% end %>
      </ul>
    </div>
  <% end %>

  <div class="field">
    <%= f.label :first_name %>
    <%= f.text_field :first_name %>
  </div>

  <div class="field">
    <%= f.label :last_name %>
    <%= f.text_field :last_name %>
  </div>

  <div class="actions">
    <%= f.submit %>
  </div>
<% end %>
----

`form_for(person)` embeddeds the two `text_fields` `:first_name` and
`:last_name` plus a `submit` Button.

The resulting HTML:

[source,html]
----
[...]
<form class="new_person" id="new_person" action="/people" accept-charset="UTF-8" method="post"><input name="utf8" type="hidden" value="&#x2713;" /><input type="hidden" name="authenticity_token" value="nMTs[...]vmeBw==" />

  <div class="field">
    <label for="person_first_name">First name</label>
    <input type="text" name="person[first_name]" id="person_first_name" />
  </div>

  <div class="field">
    <label for="person_last_name">Last name</label>
    <input type="text" name="person[last_name]" id="person_last_name" />
  </div>

  <div class="actions">
    <input type="submit" name="commit" value="Create Person" data-disable-with="Create Person" />
  </div>
</form>
[...]
----

This form uses the `post` method to upload the data to the server.

[[push-the-data-to-the-server]]
=== Push the Data to the Server

We enter "Stefan" in the `first_name` field and "Wintermeyer" in the
`last_name` field and click the submit button. The browser uses the post
method to uploads the data to the URL `/people`. The log shows:

What happened in Rails?

The router answers the request with this route

[subs=+quotes]
----
POST   /people(.:format)          people#create
----

The controller `app/controllers/people_controller.rb` runs this code

[source,ruby]
.app/controllers/people_controller.rb
----
# POST /people
# POST /people.json
def create
  @person = Person.new(person_params)

  respond_to do |format|
    if @person.save
      format.html { redirect_to @person, notice: 'Person was successfully created.' }
      format.json { render :show, status: :created, location: @person }
    else
      format.html { render :new }
      format.json { render json: @person.errors, status: :unprocessable_entity }
    end
  end
end
[...]

# Never trust parameters from the scary internet, only allow the white list through.
def person_params
  params.require(:person).permit(:first_name, :last_name)
end
----

A new instance variable `@person` is created. It represents a new Person
which was created with the params that were send from the browser to the
Rails application. The params are checked in the `person_params` method
which is a whitelist. That is done so the user can not just inject
params which we don’t want to be injected.

Once `@person` is saved a `redirect_to @person` is triggered. That would
be http://localhost:3000/people/1 in this example.

[[present-the-new-data]]
=== Present the new Data

The redirect to http://localhost:3000/people/1 is traceable in the log
file

The router answers to this request with

[subs=+quotes]
----
person GET    /people/:id(.:format)      people#show

Which gets handled be the show method in
`app/controllers/people_controller.rb`

[[generic-forms]]
== Generic Forms

A form doesn’t have to be hardwired to an ActiveRecord object. You can
use the `form_tag` helper to create a form by yourself. I use the
example of http://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html
(which is the official Rails guide about forms) to show how to create
a search form which is not connected to a model:

[source,erb]
----
<%= form_tag("/search", method: "get") do %>
  <%= label_tag(:q, "Search for:") %>
  <%= text_field_tag(:q) %>
  <%= submit_tag("Search") %>
<% end %>
----

It results in this HTML code:

[source,html]
----
<form accept-charset="UTF-8" action="/search" method="get">
  <label for="q">Search for:</label>
  <input id="q" name="q" type="text" />
  <input name="commit" type="submit" value="Search" />
</form>
----

To handle this you’d have to create a new route in `config/routes.rb`
and write a method in a controller to handle it.

[[formtaghelper]]
== FormTagHelper

There is not just a helper for text fields. Have a look at the official
API documentation for all FormTagHelpers at
http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormTagHelper.html
to get an overview. Because we use Scaffold to create a form
there is no need to memorize them. It is just important to know where to
look in case you need something else.

[[alternatives]]
== Alternatives

Many Rails developer use Simple Form as an alternative to the standard
way of defining forms. It is worth a try because you can really safe
time and most of the times it's just easier. Simple Form is available
as a Gem at https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form
